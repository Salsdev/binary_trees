# C - Binary Trees

> In this project, we dive into the world of binary trees using C, a powerful general-purpose programming language. From operating systems to databases, C is at the heart of software development. Let's explore binary trees and their applications!

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, you should be able to answer:

- What is a binary tree?
- How does a binary tree differ from a Binary Search Tree (BST)?
- What time complexity advantages do binary trees have over linked lists?
- What are the depth, height, and size of a binary tree?
- How do you traverse a binary tree using various methods?
- What makes a binary tree complete, full, perfect, or balanced?
